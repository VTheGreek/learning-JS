JavaScript Fundamentals Exercises
Overview

A collection of JavaScript exercises designed to practice core programming concepts: variables, user input, conditions, loops, nested loops, and basic math operations.

These exercises demonstrate the ability to solve problems algorithmically, handle user interactions, and create dynamic outputs in the console or browser alerts.

Key Features

- User Interaction: prompt(), alert(), console.log()
- 
- Decision Making: if, else if, else statements
- 
- Loops: for loops, nested loops for combinations and patterns
- 
- Mathematics: sums, products, factorials, multiples, prime numbers
- 
- Patterns: generating tables, sequences, and structured outputs

Example Projects

- Sum of numbers up to N
- 
- Counting or summing even/odd numbers
- 
- Multiplication tables
- 
- Identifying prime numbers
- 
- Nested loop patterns and combinations

Skills Gained

- Algorithmic thinking
- 
- Control flow mastery (loops & conditions)
- 
- Processing and validating user input
- 
- Basic problem-solving in JavaScript
